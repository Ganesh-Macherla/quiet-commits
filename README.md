## About Me

Heyyaa, I'm Ganesh Macherla, or Machu for short (as people like to call me :p) 

I'm a science student who didn’t expect to get pulled into computing. At first it wasn’t something I thought I’d care about much, but the more I keep exploring it, the more I realize how massive and creative this field really gets. Every new concept opens another door, and that curiosity is what keeps pulling me forward.

I’m still early in this journey. i haven't done anything significant in the past one year, and I'm only just starting now...but my curiosity of things i cant comprehend is just too high to be normal at this point haha. Its grown to a point where I experiment a lot, break things often, and spend more time figuring out *why* something failed than celebrating when it works. I enjoy that process...It makes me feel like I've accomplished a great thing. But anyways, I like learning quietly, improving in the background, and building skills without rushing the outcome.

I’m not trying to present myself as an expert. I’m someone who genuinely enjoys understanding how things work, pushing my limits a little at a time, and documenting the path as I grow. Consistency matters more to me than speed.

This space is part notebook and part archive
A space where I can pour my thoughts out loud and someday feel accomplished enough to say, “Yes, I’m satisfied.”
Join me on this adventure or journey or whatever you wanna call it. I’m just excited to see where it leads.
