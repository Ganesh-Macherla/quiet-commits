Heyya
I said that I'd be doing this regularly, but a gap of 12 days is just...ouchh
I had Mid Sem exams, not like its my fault. But I like to think that it is...indeed my fault
You see, growing up as a single child has many problems...you grow up to be a defective depressive adult with no rael friends, money, employment or anything infact... you're just a sore loser who feeds on copium that one day he shall amount to something useful and be successful for once in his life but that is never gonna happen in a billion years because you're too weak to take an initiative...ahm ahm, now where was I?
Ahhh yesss, growing up as a songle child has many problems, one of them is being pampered...and I? Hooo boy did i get pampered by people around me, not in a way that you are thinking (like that one spoiled rich bratty kid who htinks his father is the richest in the world and can summon a godzill a out of his pockets if he wanted to)...its the kind where i never struggled to do things.
Food? Mom's got me full for days with her yummy dosas
Need any stationary or any toy or anything in general...Dad makes sure i have it within a week
Now being a middle class family has its own challenges, but my parents made sure that I never faced any struggle in any matter. They made sure that I didn't  miss out on many things that they did during there childhood..which im absolutely blessed to have, and I'll make sure to pay them back, but thats a topic for another day.
I wont necessarily say all of this "pampering" made me lazy (i mean kinda..), a better word for it is being careless, that along with being somewhat of an introvert growing up...and let's get real here.

I always felt like I was living inside a soft bubble...protected, comfortable, but slightly disconnected from the sharp edges of the real world. While other kids were figuring things out the hard way, making mistakes in public, learning to negotiate, to argue, to lose...I was quietly observing. And somewhere along the way, comfort turned into hesitation. Hesitation turned into overthinking. Overthinking turned into inaction.It’s strange, because from the outside everything looked fine. Good parents, decent grades, no major problems. But internally, I think I never developed that raw instinct to push myself when things got uncomfortable (uk like every other human does in this world smh). I wasn’t forced to. There was always a cushion. Always a fallback. And when you grow up like that...initiative doesn’t come naturally...you wait. You wait for instructions. You wait for motivation. You wait for the “right time.” And sometimes that waiting feels like a weakness.Being an introvert didn’t help either. I was always more in my head than in the moment. Conversations felt exhausting. Crowds felt overwhelming. So I chose the easier route...stay small, stay quiet, stay safe. But safety has a cost. You don’t grow much inside it.

And now, when I look at myself trying to build discipline, trying to build something meaningful, trying to prove...mostly to myself...that I’m capable...somewhere, I see the friction. The gap between potential and action. The part of me that wants more, and the part of me that is scared to demand it.
