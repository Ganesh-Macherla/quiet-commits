Heyya
I said that I'd be doing this regularly, but a gap of 12 days is just...ouchh
I had Mid Sem exams, not like its my fault. But I like to think that it is...indeed my fault
You see, growing up as a single child has many problems...you grow up to be a defective depressive adult with no real friends, money, employment or anything, infact... you're just a sore loser who feeds on copium that one day he shall amount to something useful and be successful for once in his life but that is never gonna happen in a billion years because you're too weak to take an initiative...ahm ahm, now where was I?
Ahhh yesss, growing up as a single child has many problems, one of them is being pampered...and I? Hooo boy did i get pampered by people around me, not in a way that you are thinking (like that one spoiled rich bratty kid who thinks his father is the richest in the world and can summon a pony out of his pockets if he wanted to)...its the kind where i never struggled to do things.
Food? Mom's got me full for days with her yummy dosas.
Need any stationary or any toy or anything in general...Dad makes sure i have it within a week
Now being a middle class family has its own challenges, but my parents made sure that I never faced any struggle in any matter. They made sure that I didn't  miss out on many things that they did during there childhood..which im absolutely blessed to have, and I'll make sure to pay them back, but thats a topic for another day.
I wont necessarily say all of this "pampering" made me lazy (i mean kinda..), a better word for it is being careless, that along with me being somewhat of an introvert growing up...and let's get real here.

I always felt like I was living inside a soft bubble...protected, comfortable, but slightly disconnected from the real world. While other kids were figuring things out the hard way, making mistakes in public, learning to negotiate, to argue, to lose...I was quietly observing. And somewhere along the way, comfort turned into hesitation. Hesitation turned into overthinking. Overthinking turned into inaction. It’s strange, because from the outside everything looked fine. No major problems. But internally, I think I never developed that raw instinct to push myself when things got uncomfortable (uk like every other human does in this world smh). I wasn’t forced to. There was always a cushion. Always a fallback. And when you grow up like that...initiative doesn’t come naturally...you wait. You wait for instructions. You wait for motivation. You wait for the “right time”. And sometimes that waiting feels like a weakness. Being an introvert didn’t help either. I was always more in my head than in the moment. Conversations felt exhausting. Crowds felt overwhelming. So I chose the easier route...stay small, stay quiet, stay safe. But safety has a cost. You don’t grow much inside it.

And now, when I look at myself trying to build discipline, trying to build something meaningful, trying to prove...mostly to myself...that I’m capable...somewhere, I see the friction. The gap between potential and action. The part of me that wants more, and the part of me that is scared to demand it.

And I think that’s exactly why I didn’t update the blog during mid sems. This whole ordeal might be a bit dramatic, its stupid little blog anyway....Well this stupid little blog was supposed to be my proof...that I can stay consistent even when no one’s forcing me to. It’s easy to say, “I had exams”... And that’s true. Mid sems weren’t exactly a vacation. But if I’m being brutally honest, I could have carved out thirty minutes. I could have written something small. I could have stayed consistent. The time wasn’t entirely the problem...the mindset was.

Exams became the perfect excuse. A socially acceptable reason to pause something I promised myself I’d do “regularly”. And that’s where that old pattern sneaks back in...the one I probably built 15 years ago. The idea that as long as there’s a valid reason, I don’t have to push. I don’t have to stretch. I don’t have to inconvenience myself. Mid sems were a reason, sure...but not an excuse big enough to disappear for twelve days. Maybe it’s small, but if I can’t show up for something this small, what does that say about the bigger things?

It’s not that I was incapable. It’s that I didn’t force myself to operate slightly above comfortable. I didn’t challenge the version of me that defaults to minimum required effort. And that’s the scary part...logic always sounds reasonable. It prolly seems overly dramatic to anyone reading this, But they’re not inside my head when these small lapses start feeling symbolic. Because to me, it was never just about this. It was about the zone I built for myself over the years...that comfortable space where I function well enough, avoid major failure, but rarely push beyond what’s required. Growing up protected and provided for, never truly forced to struggle...(its a pretty minor mistake which seems normal but goes along way and honestly i could just rant about this one topic for hours) it truly shaped me in ways I’m only now beginning to see clearly.

So when I didn’t update the blog during mid sems, the dramatic spiral wasn’t just about twelve days. It was about recognizing that same familiar pattern again... the reasonable excuse followed by the quiet postponement and the “I’ll start properly after this”... That zone isn’t evil. It helped me survive?...sure, helped me stay safe?...sure. But it also kept me from testing myself.

On a concluding note, I'd like to say that I'm not some defective, derranged and depressed kid doomed by childhood comfort loll (what am i even saying bruh). I'm just someone who was never forced to build this kind of discipline early, and now since I finally realize it. I have to start building it continously. And to be honest, that's a resposnibility worth taking upon myself.

Also I probably won’t update this blog daily anyway, prolly more like weekly once or twice if I get lucky :p...but none of this is a waste, I PROMISE.(This counts for atleast something right?...riiiighttt???)
And maybe I need that space...because there are way too many thoughts running in my head at a given moment. And if I tried to compress all of that into neat daily entries, I’d either burn out...or dramatically declare a mid-life crisis at 20 lmfao. So yeah, I’ve got a lot to unpack up here, and I’d rather do it slowly than implode into million pieces trying to speedrun self-development lol.
